# Advanced Employee Productivity & Wellbeing Analytics with Smart Clustering and Predictive Insights

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee productivity, performance, and wellbeing using advanced data analytics techniques. By leveraging a custom **Productivity Index**, clustering algorithms, anomaly detection, predictive modeling, and trend analysis, it uncovers actionable insights to help organizations enhance workforce efficiency and wellbeing.

The project showcases how data-driven decision-making can improve employee satisfaction, reduce burnout, and optimize task allocation.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Employee Performance and Productivity Data**  
[Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/employee-performance-and-productivity-data)

Key attributes in the dataset include:
- Employee demographics
- Hours worked per day
- Performance scores
- Satisfaction levels
- Task types and efficiency metrics
- Date-wise records for trend analysis

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** â€“ For data exploration, modeling, and visualization  
- **Google Sheets** â€“ For creating interactive dashboards with pivot tables, slicers, and charts

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. **Productivity Index**
A composite metric that integrates performance, satisfaction, and hours worked to measure employee efficiency.

### 2. **Employee Clustering**
K-Means clustering grouped employees into actionable segments:
- At-Risk
- Steady Performers
- High Potential

### 3. **Anomaly Detection**
Isolation Forest identified employees with unusual patterns in productivity, enabling targeted support.

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
Linear Regression and Random Forest models forecast how changes in workload and satisfaction could influence performance outcomes.

### 5. **Trend & Correlation Analysis**
Time-series and heatmap visualizations uncovered patterns over weeks and correlations between work habits and productivity.

### 6. **Interactive Google Sheets Dashboard**
Pivot tables, slicers, and conditional formatting allowed dynamic exploration of the data by departments, clusters, and time frames.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Departments with moderate work hours and higher satisfaction showed superior productivity.
- Clustering revealed a subset of employees at risk of burnout.
- Predictive modeling indicated that improving satisfaction by 10% could enhance performance by up to 1.66% in certain departments.
- Anomalies corresponded to specific periods of high stress and project deadlines.
- Trend analysis suggested productivity dips on Mondays and peaks mid-week.
